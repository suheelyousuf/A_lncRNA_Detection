# AI_lncRNA_Detection
## A deep learning model for the prediction of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
In this repo, we present a deep learning model with k-mer as the only feature for classifying lncRNAs and mRNAs from RNA sequences alone. Our deep learning model has an accuracy of up to 98.2%. 
In addition, this study proposes five other Machine Learning algorithms, namely Naive Bayes (NB), AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), support vector machine and Random Forest(RF) Classifiers, to predict lncRNAs from RNA-seq data. The accuracy of these models is compared to that of our deep learning model, and the best model for classification is then recommended.
